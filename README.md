# Diabetes-Fat
Generally, the incidence of type II diabetes is associated with poor diet and lack of exercise. In particular, studies have shown that fat intake can increase the risk of type II diabetes. For example, consumption of animal fats could lead to a higher risk of Type II diabetes than plant fats. While this relationship has been shown to exist, it has not been extensively studied. Predicting diabetes can be a difficult task for medical professionals, and adding variables that could be significant indicators of diabetes could help create more accurate diagnoses. Thus, the motivation of this research is to predict diabetes based on the types of fats consumed using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In this study, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, saturated, and total fat are used as inputs to a support vector machine to test if it is possible to classify people as diabetic based on these features. While this was a promising method, it was determined that diabetes cannot be predicted in this way.
